# Easy as Pie - UI
> React component library that is easy as pie to theme and implement on any site.

## Credits
Several projects aided in inspiring this project. Notably they are:

- [Create React Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router)

## Things I Learned
I have learned so many neat things while doing this project. The first was how create a working npm package that anyone could use in their project. This was made very easy by using the `create-react-libary` package mentioned above because it set's up the project so that you can create your package and test all in one.

This was my first react project in conjunction with [Bruner Dynamics](https://github.com/richardtaylordawson/bruner-dynamics), another one of my projects in Github. Because of this, I was able to learn the basics of react as well as how implement routing with Reach Router.

The last thing I really enjoyed was figuring out how to make my component library completely themeable. This is something that was very difficult to figure out, but fun to do and will continue to improve it so that the end user can customize and use it without needing to build components from scratch.
